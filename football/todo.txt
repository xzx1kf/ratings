# change load_data.py to three separate scripts load_teams.py load_divisions.py
  and load_matches.py

# sort out the required pages and their names. analysis should probably be
  something like football/match/06/detail

# retreive odds automatically. 

# add the other leagues. Or a filter on the fixtures page to select the
